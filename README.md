# SudokuSolver

This is a version of Sudoku that solves itself using a backtracking algorithm and displays the changes live on the GUI.
The user can play Sudoku with the provided puzzle or hit enter and allow the algorithm to solve the puzzle itself.
If the user runs the solve command, then they are disqualifed from winning, but if they solve the puzzle themselves then they get a win message

### Future Updates

Currently the only way to change the puzzle is the manually change the values in the board inside of the code.
In the future, a puzzle creator or multiple sudoku puzzles will be added for the user to play.


### Run

Run sudokuGrid.py to play the GUI version of sudoku and see the backtracking algorithm work
Run sudokuSolver.py to try out any puzzle in the console for a much faster solution
